          I'm a for youth proof live performance stan first, human second.
          I love coffee and I delude myself into thinking that caffein is a good source of motivation.
          My hobby is obsessively reading cardan's desperate letters to jude.
          My research focuses on the importance of constantly reminding the sea god that his soul is of a lotus flower and although it's not as large as a mountain or as bright as the moon, its just as beautiful because it's his soul. It's strong, resilient, and steadfast and stubborn and worthy, just as he is.

                His face was quickly popularized worldwide in a Fake Text meme by Instagram’s @livewithflip:The original screenshot that started the Polite Cat craze. But what emotion does it display? Contemporary Internet interpretations (interpre(net)ations?) range from veiled annoyance or awkward encounters between strangers to genuine politeness and gratitude. Can all emotions be conveyed in this one simple picture? Is Ollie's sweet, silly face the only thing in the world that matters?
                Probably. Only time will tell.

              To demonstrate exasperated confusion, few images are as meme-able. And none haunt my nightmares as frequently as Persian Cat Room Guardian. </td>
